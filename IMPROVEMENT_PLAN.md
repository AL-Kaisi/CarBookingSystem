## Benefits of PostgreSQL Migration

1. **Cost**: Completely free and open-source
2. **Accessibility**: Easy to install and run locally
3. **Portability**: Works on all major operating systems
4. **Community**: Large, active community support
5. **Features**: Rich feature set comparable to commercial databases
6. **Performance**: Excellent performance for most use cases

## Next Steps

1. Test the installation on various PostgreSQL versions
2. Add Docker support for easier deployment
3. Create web interface for the booking system
4. Implement REST API endpoints
5. Add automated backup procedures

This migration ensures the Car Booking System can be freely used, modified, and distributed while maintaining professional quality and features.
